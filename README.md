### About this Project

> MediPlus is a digital hospital/medical web application, which is convenient not only for the management but also for the doctors and patients to reduce the hassle between them. Here every management is     easy to control for the managers, whether it is appointment medical test management or patient and doctor management. Everything is together in the manager dashboard. Which gives ultimate control of the     whole system. Also, doctors do not need to make tons of inquiries about reports or past treatments from the patients. As, all the patient's appointments, medical tests and other medical history are present   with the patient account, which is easily accessible to the doctors. It also saves the time and money of the patients, as they can pre-appoint appointments with doctors and medical tests. Moreover, the     test reports and all the prescriptions for doctor appointments are added to their account and accessible anytime. Patients can also add their necessary medical information and upload their past medical       records/reports to their account, which makes it easier for doctors to understand their health situation.
